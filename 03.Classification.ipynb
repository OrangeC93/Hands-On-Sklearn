    "### Precision-Recall-F1\n",
    "- The confusion matrix gives you a lot of information, but sometimes you may prefer a single-number metric.\n",
    "- An interesting one to look at is the model's accuracy over its positive predictions, named *precision*:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$precision = \\frac{TP}{TP+FP}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- A trivial way to have a perfect precision of $1$ is to make one prediction that you're sure it's correct, by consequence $FP=0$ and $precision=1$.\n",
    "    - This would not be useful since the evaluation is ignore all but the true positives.\n",
    "- Precision is typically used along with another metric named recall.\n",
    "- recall, also called sensitivity or the True Positive rate is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$recall = \\frac{TP}{TP+FN}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- The recall score is not good at all.\n",
    "    - its dominator consists of TPs & **False Negatives**, we can conclude that our model is predicting a lot of digits as not \"5\" but they're \"5\"s.\n",
    "    - The model is not good at predicting False Negatives.\n",
    "- Now our model doesn't look as shiny as it was when we looked at its accuracy.\n",
    "- When it claims that a digit represents a \"5\" it's only correct for $83\\%$ of the times.\n",
    "- It's often convinient to combine the precision and accuracy scores into a single metric called the $F_{1}$ score.\n",
    "    - In particular, if you want to compare two classifiers.\n",
    "    - The $F_{1}$ score represents the harmonic mean of the precision & recall metrics.\n",
    "        - Harmonic because it gives more importance to low values in its formula.\n",
    "        - Meaning, the F1 score will only give you high scores if both precision and recall are high.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F_{1}=\\frac{2}{\\frac{1}{precision}+\\frac{1}{recall}}=2 \\times \\frac{precision \\times recall}{precision + recall}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Precision-Recall Trade-off\n",
    "- To understand this trade-off, we need to know how the algorithm is making its decisions.\n",
    "- For each instance, the classifier outputs a score (we can call it a probability)\n",
    "- If the score is higher than a certain threshold, we label the instance as positive (a \"5\")\n",
    "- If the score is less than the threshold, we the instance as negative (a \"not 5\")\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align:center\"><img style=\"width: 50%\" src=\"static/imgs/precision-recall-trade.png\" /></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "- As you can notice, if we raise the threshold, precision converges to $100%$, but as a result, we lower the recall.\n",
    "    - Same happens to recall if we lower the threshold, we get a better recall (False Negatives are fewer) but we decrease precision. \n",
    "- Scikit-learn doesn't allow you to set the threshold directly, but it can give you the scores for each of its prediction.\n",
    "    - You can set the threshold you want after getting the scores:"

    "- Another startegy is to train a binary classifier for each pair of digits.\n",
    "    - This is called 1-vs-1.\n",
    "    - If there are $N$ classes, you need to train $\\frac{N \\times (N-1)}{2}$.\n",
    "    - For the MNIST Problem, this means training $45$ binary classifiers.\n",
    "    - **and see which class wins the most duals**.\n",
    "    - Even though we need to create many classifiers, they are needed to be trained on only the data points where one of the classes appeared.\n",
